How to Embed DevExpress Control in WPF Dashboard

This example demonstrates how to embed a [DevExpress Gantt Control](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/wpf/archive/2018/10/31/wpf-gantt-control-ctp-v18-2.aspx) in a dashboard loaded in [WPF Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/119813) and bind the Gantt control to the dashboard's data. It uses a style selector to substitute the regular dashboard item with an arbitrary WPF control and handles its SizeChanged event to provide it with data.
